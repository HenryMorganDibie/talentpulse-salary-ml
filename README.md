# TalentPulse Salary ML Pipeline

> **End-to-end supervised regression pipeline for tech job market salary prediction.**  
> Built as a Senior Data Associate assessment submission for 10Alytics — HR Analytics & Labour Markets track.  
> Trained on 4,653 global job postings across 5 countries and 4 seniority tiers.

## Business Context

TalentPulse Analytics needed a data-driven salary benchmarking model to replace manual lookup tables. The core problem: existing tooling ignores seniority effects, geographic market variance, and in-demand skill premiums — leading to systematically inaccurate salary recommendations.

This pipeline addresses those gaps through a structured ML regression approach:

- Seniority encoding (Senior/Lead roles command a documented 45–80% salary premium)
- Country-level market segmentation across 5 English-speaking tech markets
- Skill scarcity flags for Python, SQL, Spark, and AWS
- Leakage-free feature engineering (`salary_min`/`salary_max` explicitly excluded)

## Pipeline Steps

| Step | Module | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `src/data/loader.py` | Load dataset, schema validation, EDA distributions |
| 2 | `src/data/loader.py` | Filter labelled rows (has_salary=True), drop duplicates, parse skills |
| 3 | `src/features/engineering.py` | `is_senior`, `experience_tier`, skill flags, OHE, log1p target transform |
| 4 | `src/models/train.py` | Train LR, Ridge, RF, GB with 5-fold GridSearchCV; Ridge alpha CV search |
| 5 | `src/evaluation/metrics.py` | MAE/RMSE/R², feature importances, VIF, residual bias plots, segment analysis |

---

## Model Results

All metrics computed on a stratified 20% hold-out test set (459 rows, stratified by `job_level`). Target is `log1p(salary_avg)`; metrics are reported on the inverse-transformed (USD) scale.

| Model             |     MAE |       RMSE |     R²  |
|-------------------|--------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Linear Regression | $42,832 |  $140,653  | 0.6217  |
| Ridge Regression  | $42,834 |  $140,672  | 0.6217  |
| **Random Forest** | **$42,064** | **$142,764** | **0.6104** |
| Gradient Boosting | $43,804 |  $149,747  | 0.6029  |

**Random Forest** achieves the lowest MAE — best average prediction accuracy.  
**Linear/Ridge** achieve the highest R² — strongest overall variance explanation and more robustness to extreme outliers.

> ⚠️ **Note on RMSE:** All models show high RMSE relative to MAE. This is driven by extreme salary outliers in the India segment (likely USD/INR currency mixing in the source data — median India salary is ~10× other markets). See [`reports/benchmarking_memo.md`](reports/benchmarking_memo.md) §4 for full diagnostics and the data card for the investigation recommendation.

## Feature Engineering

All features are stateless transforms — no train-set statistics are applied, making the pipeline safe for direct inference on new postings.

| Feature | Type | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `is_senior` | Binary | Senior/Lead flag; captures documented 45–80% seniority premium |
| `experience_tier` | Ordinal (0–3) | Buckets 0–2yr / 3–5yr / 6–9yr / 10+yr; robust to 90% missingness |
| `skill_python/sql/spark/aws` | Binary | Scarcity-premium flags for high-demand technical skills |
| `num_skills` | Integer | Role complexity proxy; correlates with seniority |
| `is_remote_int` | Binary | Boolean cast to int for model compatibility |
| OHE: `job_level` | 4 columns | Junior / Mid / Senior / Lead one-hot encoded |
| OHE: `country` | 5 columns | USA / UK / Canada / Australia / India one-hot encoded |

**Leakage prevention:** `salary_min` and `salary_max` are never used as features — both are direct inputs to `salary_avg = (min + max) / 2`. Including them would inflate R² artificially and make the model non-deployable on real postings that lack salary disclosure.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Log1p target transform** — salary distributions are right-skewed; log transform reduces outlier influence and improves linear model fit (confirmed by Q-Q plots)
- **No StandardScaler** — tree models are scale-invariant; Ridge handles ill-conditioning via L2; VIF confirms no multicollinearity (all VIF < 3)
- **Stratified split on job_level** — prevents a bad random draw from placing all Lead/Senior roles in one partition
- **Index preserved through split** — `train_test_split_stratified` does not call `reset_index`, ensuring `df_ohe.loc[test_df.index]` alignment is correct in residuals analysis
